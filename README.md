Hi, <b> I'm Shyam  ðŸ‘‹</b> -- second year engineering student studying at Government College of Engineering, Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu. I like learning and experimenting with new technologies, building small projects and occassionally tinkering with electronics.

<i>*NOTE: Most used languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages I have the most code on github.</i>
